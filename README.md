# ScrollDrag

There are situations that it would be nice for the user to be able to also scroll using a mouse drag. That's why I
created this angular library.


## How to get started
```shell
npm install -Save 
```
Add `ngxScrollDrag` on a scrolling element, now that element can also be scrolled by a mouse drag. [**See the Demo**](https://azerafati.com/scroll-drag/)


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


----

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
