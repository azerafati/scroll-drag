# ScrollDrag

There are situations that it would be nice for the user to be able to also scroll using a mouse drag. That's why I
created this angular library.

## How to get started

just use the `ngxScrollDrag` on a scrolling element, now that element can also be scrolled by a mouse drag. look at the Demo 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
